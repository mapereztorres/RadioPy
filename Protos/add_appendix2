The appendix2 module assembles a group of constants and functions used in the theory for better comprehension and use of the mathematical expresions derived from the theoretical formalism of the synchrotron radiation of relativistic electrons.


F(x): maximum value at x=0.29

:param x: 	The ratio between the frequency and the critical frequency of the synchrotron 			radiation of a single electron in vacuum. The critical frequency depends on the 		square of the energy of a single monochromatic wave -nu_c(E^2)-.

:param tauM:	The optical depth for frequency nu_M. nu_M=0.29*nu_c(E_0). 

:param z:	Just a variable of the function. At expression 3.53 z=nu/nu_1 where nu_1 is 			defined by the condition tau(nu_1)=1.



:param alpha:	Spectral index alpha=(p-1)/2
